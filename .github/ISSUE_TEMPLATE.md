Is it a problem with (1) the book's contents or (2) code running on your computer:

(1) If it's a problem with the book's content please link to the place in the book where you found the problem. This is section 1.2, for example:

http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/intro.html#why-geocomputation-with-r

(2) If it's a problem with the code please briefly describe what you did, the output you got and the output you expected.
Include a minimal reproducible example (AKA a reprex). If you've never heard of a [reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before, check out <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>.
